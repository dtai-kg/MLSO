                             skos:definition "Syntactic Language Processing refers to the computational analysis of the structure and arrangement of words within a sentence to understand the grammatical relationships and roles each word plays. In this field, algorithms and models are employed to parse and analyze the syntactic structure of natural language, identifying components such as nouns, verbs, and modifiers, as well as the relationships between them. Syntactic processing is crucial for various natural language processing tasks, including part-of-speech tagging, parsing, and syntactic dependency analysis. By decoding the grammatical structure of language, syntactic language processing contributes to the broader goal of enabling machines to comprehend and generate human-like sentences." ;
